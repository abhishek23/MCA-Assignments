Q.4 Give difference between Structure and Union.
->
	Keyword:
		Structure - The keyword struct is used to define a structure.
		Union - The keyword union is used to define an union.
		
	Size:
		Structure - Whe a variable is associated with a structure, the compiler allocates the memory for each member.
					The size of structure is greater than or equal to the sum od sizes of its members.
		Union - When a variable is associated with an union, the compiler allocates the memory by considering the size of the largest memory.
				So, size of union is equal to the size of largest member.
		
	Memory:
		Structure - Each member within a structure is assigned unique storage area of location.
		Union - Memory allocated is shared by individual members of union.
	
	Value Altering:
		Structure - Altering the value of a member will not affect other members of the structure.
		Union - Altering the value of any of the member will alter the other member values.
	
	Accessing Members:
		Structure - Individual member can be accessed at a time.
		Union - Only one member can be accessed at a time.
		
	Initialization of Members:
		Structure - Several members of a structure can initialize once.
		Union - Only the first member of a union can be initialized.
