Q.1 What are control structures in C? Explain.
-> In C, we have 32 standard keywords and out of them 12 (the keywords in the second column of the following table) are control statements.

These statements control the flow of the program and out of them some are selection statements, 
some are iterative statements and some other are jumping statements.

1. The if statement in C language is used to perform operation on the basis of condition. By using if-else statement, you can perform operation either condition is true or false.

	There are many ways to use if statement in C language:

	If statement
		The single if statement in C language is used to execute the code if condition is true.
		The syntax of if statement is given below:
		
		Snippets:
			if(expression){  
				//code to be executed  
			}  
		
	If-else statement
		The if-else statement in C language is used to execute the code if condition is true or false.
		The syntax of if-else statement is given below:
		
		Snippets:
			if(expression){  
				//code to be executed if condition is true  
			}else{  
				//code to be executed if condition is false  
			}
			
	If else-if ladder
		The if else-if statement is used to execute one code from multiple conditions.
		The syntax of if else-if statement is given below:
		
		Snippets:
			if(condition1){  
				//code to be executed if condition1 is true  
			}else if(condition2){  
				//code to be executed if condition2 is true  
			}  
			else if(condition3){  
				//code to be executed if condition3 is true  
			}  
			...  
			else{  
				//code to be executed if all the conditions are false  
			}
			
	Nested if
		A nested if is an if statement that is the target of another if statement.
		Nested if statements means an if statement inside another if statement. 
		C allows us to nest if statements within if statements. i.e, we can place an if statement inside another if statement.
		
		Snippets:
			if (condition1){
			
			   // Executes when condition1 is true
			   if (condition2) 
			   {
				  // Executes when condition2 is true
			   }
			}
